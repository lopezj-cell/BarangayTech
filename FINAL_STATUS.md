# 🎉 FINAL STATUS - Almost There!

## ✅ What's Fixed

### 1. **Corrupted File Cleaned**
The `AuthService.cs` file was corrupted (mixed old and new code). I've recreated it with:
- ✅ Correct Firebase Web API Key: `AIzaSyDlAfxJmkoQYjEm7TMf1xMv2r0YtCHaqLk`
- ✅ Android Emulator support: `https://10.0.2.2:7241/` (instead of localhost)
- ✅ SSL certificate handling for self-signed certs
- ✅ Comprehensive debug logging

### 2. **What Happened**
Your login got to Firebase successfully! The debug showed:
```
Firebase Response Status: OK ✓
Firebase Token Received: eyJhbGci... ✓
Local ID from Firebase: cPrOUhIQQgOOlBJyAWH5X0hnlgz1 ✓
```

But then failed at:
```
Backend URL: https://localhost:7241/api/auth/verify-token ✗
Exception: Connection failure
```

**Why?** Android emulator can't reach `localhost` on your PC!

### 3. **The Fix**
Changed backend URL from `https://localhost:7241/` to `https://10.0.2.2:7241/`

`10.0.2.2` is a special alias in Android emulator that points to your host machine's localhost.

## 🐛 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Issue: "Connection failure" to backend
**Check**:
1. Backend is running (see Step 1)
2. You can access https://localhost:7241/swagger in your browser
3. Firewall isn't blocking port 7241

**Test Backend**:
```powershell
curl -k https://localhost:7241/swagger/index.html
```

Should return HTML, not an error.

### Issue: "EMAIL_NOT_FOUND" from Firebase
**Solution**: User doesn't exist. Run:
```powershell
.\create-test-users.ps1
```

### Issue: "Deployment" error persists
**Solution**:
1. Right-click **BarangayTech.Maui** project
2. Select **Set as Startup Project**
3. Try again

### Issue: SSL Certificate error
Already handled! The HttpClient now accepts self-signed certificates.
