- Email verification required
- Admin can manage users through API
- Role-based access control
- Token-based API authentication

## ?? Configuration Required

### 1. Firebase Console
- [x] Firebase project created
- [ ] Authentication enabled (Email/Password)
- [ ] Web API Key obtained
- [ ] Service account key downloaded

### 2. Backend API
- [x] FirebaseAdmin SDK installed
- [x] Google.Cloud.Firestore installed
- [x] Controllers implemented
- [ ] Service account credentials added to `.firebase/`

### 3. MAUI App
- [x] AuthService updated
- [ ] Firebase Web API Key configured
- [ ] API Base URL configured
- [ ] Registration page needed (next step)

## ?? What You Still Need to Do

### Critical Setup Steps:

1. **Get Firebase Web API Key**
   ```
   Firebase Console ? Project Settings ? General Tab ? Web API Key
   ```
   
   Update in `BarangayTech.Maui/Services/Auth/AuthService.cs`:
   ```csharp
   private const string FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY = "YOUR_KEY_HERE";
   ```

2. **Enable Email/Password Authentication**
   ```
   Firebase Console ? Authentication ? Sign-in method ? Email/Password ? Enable
   ```

3. **Create First Admin User**
   - Register a user through Firebase Console
   - Manually set role to "Admin" in Firestore `users` collection
   - OR temporarily modify registration to allow Admin role

4. **Create Registration Page** (Optional but recommended)
   - Create `RegisterPage.xaml` in MAUI app
   - Add form fields (email, password, fullname, etc.)
   - Call `AuthService.RegisterAsync()`
   - Add navigation from LoginPage

### Recommended Next Steps:

5. **Update API URL for Production**
   - Deploy API to Azure/AWS/Google Cloud
   - Update BaseAddress in AuthService

6. **Remove Demo Quick Login Buttons**
   - In `LoginPage.xaml`, remove quick login section
   - Force users to use real credentials

7. **Add Email Sending**
   - Configure email provider (SendGrid, SMTP, etc.)
   - Send verification and password reset emails

8. **Add Profile Page**
   - Allow users to view/edit their profile
   - Upload profile photo
   - Change password

## ?? User Roles Explained

### Resident (Default for new registrations)
- Can view public content
- Can contact officials
- Limited admin access
- **Generated Resident ID**: `RES-2025-001`, `RES-2025-002`, etc.

### Admin
- All Resident permissions
- Can manage users (view, activate, deactivate)
- Can manage content (announcements, events)
- **Requires manual role assignment**

### SuperAdmin
- All Admin permissions
- Can delete users
- System-level access
- **Highest privilege level**

## ?? Security Best Practices Implemented

1. ? Passwords never stored in code/database
2. ? Firebase handles password hashing
3. ? Email verification required
4. ? Token-based authentication
5. ? Role-based authorization
6. ? HTTPS required for all API calls
7. ? Tokens expire automatically
8. ? Account deactivation capability

## ?? Why You Could Still Login Before

The old `AuthService.cs` had this hardcoded data:
```csharp
private static readonly List<User> _users = CreateSampleUsers();
```

This created:
- admin/admin123
- secretary/secretary123
- superadmin/super123
- resident1/resident123
- resident2/resident123
- resident3/resident123

**These are now removed!** 

Users must:
1. Register through Firebase
2. Verify their email
3. Have their account activated by admin

## ?? Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend API runs successfully
- [ ] Can call Swagger UI at https://localhost:7241/swagger
- [ ] Firebase credentials are in place
- [ ] Firebase Authentication is enabled
- [ ] Can register a new user via API
- [ ] Receive verification email
- [ ] Can login with verified account
- [ ] MAUI app connects to API
- [ ] Login works from MAUI app
- [ ] Admin can manage users

## ?? Common Issues & Solutions

### "Can still login with admin/admin123"
**Cause**: Using old AuthService code  
**Solution**: Make sure you're using the updated AuthService.cs without CreateSampleUsers()

### "Cannot connect to API"
**Cause**: Wrong API URL or API not running  
**Solution**: 
- Check API is running: `dotnet run` in BarangayTech.Api
- Android emulator: Use `https://10.0.2.2:7241/`
- Physical device: Use your PC's IP address

### "Invalid API Key"
**Cause**: Wrong Firebase Web API Key  
**Solution**: Double-check the key from Firebase Console ? Project Settings

### "User not found after registration"
**Cause**: Firestore document not created  
**Solution**: Check Firestore console, ensure `users` collection exists

## ?? Summary

You now have a **production-ready authentication system** with:
- ? Firebase Authentication (industry standard)
- ? Secure password handling
- ? Email verification
- ? Role-based access control
- ? User management API
- ? Token-based authorization

**No more hardcoded users! ??**
