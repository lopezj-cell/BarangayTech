# Firebase Backend Setup Complete! ??

Your BarangayTech backend has been successfully migrated from MongoDB to Firebase Firestore!

## ? What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Backend API** (BarangayTech.Api)
- ? FirebaseService for Firestore integration
- ? All controllers updated to use Firebase:
  - AdministrativeTasksController (Full CRUD)
  - AnnouncementsController (Full CRUD)
  - ServicesController (Full CRUD)
  - EventsController (Full CRUD)
  - OfficialsController (Full CRUD)
  - AiController (unchanged - no database dependency)

### 2. **Data Models**
- ? AdministrativeTask
- ? Announcement
- ? Service
- ? Event
- ? Official

All models are properly decorated with Firestore attributes.

### 3. **Firebase MCP Server**
- ? Configured in `.mcp.json`
- ? Uses Firebase CLI tools
- ? Allows AI assistant to interact with your Firebase database

## ?? Next Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing "BarangayTech" project
3. Note your **Project ID** (should be "barangaytech" or similar)

### Step 2: Download Service Account Key
1. In Firebase Console, click ?? **Settings** ? **Project Settings**
2. Go to **Service Accounts** tab
3. Click **"Generate New Private Key"**
4. Save the JSON file as:
   ```
   .firebase/barangaytech-firebase-key.json
   ```

### Step 3: Enable Firestore Database
1. In Firebase Console, go to **Build** ? **Firestore Database**
2. Click **Create Database**
3. Choose **Start in test mode** (for development)
4. Select a location (e.g., us-central)

### Step 4: Update Configuration
Update `appsettings.json` with your actual Firebase Project ID (already done if it's "barangaytech"):
```json
{
  "Firebase": {
    "ProjectId": "your-actual-project-id",
    "CredentialPath": ".firebase/barangaytech-firebase-key.json"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Restart Visual Studio
After placing the credentials file, restart Visual Studio to activate the Firebase MCP server.

## ?? Running the API

```bash
cd BarangayTech.Api
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at:
- HTTPS: https://localhost:7241
- HTTP: http://localhost:5000

- ?? Never commit this file to version control
- ?? For production, use environment variables or secure secret management
- ?? Update Firestore security rules before deploying to production

## ?? MAUI App (BarangayTech.Maui)

The MAUI app is configured for **Android only** for faster builds:
- TargetFramework: `net9.0-android`
- To add other platforms, edit `BarangayTech.Maui.csproj`

## ?? Firebase MCP Server

Once you have the credentials in place and restart Visual Studio, I (the AI assistant) will be able to:
- Read/write data to your Firestore database
- Help you manage collections
- Query and filter data
- Assist with database structure
